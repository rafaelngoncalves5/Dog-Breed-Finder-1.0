I will create objects for the dogs class, each object will be a dog breed. 
I tried to get the input from the user and use it as the attributes, the main code will 
catch these attributes passed by the user and compare to the created instances in order
to find as precisely as possible the dog breed. The software was created based in the
most popular dog breeds of the world.

I could possibly do this software much more easily, but I wanted to create something with OOP.

fur:  1 = Slight, 2 = Medium, 3 = Voluminous
ears: 1 = Pointed and up, 2 = Rounded and down
height: 1 = Tiny, 2 = Medium, 3 = Tall
length: 1 = Short, 2 = Medium, 3 = Long
Unique Characteristic 1 and 2: List of characteristics

There's still much to do...
